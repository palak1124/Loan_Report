**BANK LOAN REPORT**

**Problem Statement:**

In response to the imperative need for a robust monitoring system for our bank's lending activities, we embark on creating a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report serves as a pivotal tool to gauge the performance of our loan portfolio, empowering us to make informed decisions and adapt strategies in a dynamic financial landscape.

**Dashboard 1: Summary**

*Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:*

1. **Total Loan Applications:** Tracking the influx of loan applications is paramount. We monitor the total number of loan applications received during specified periods, assessing both Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
  
2. **Total Funded Amount:** Understanding the magnitude of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We closely examine the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyze the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations.
  
3. **Total Amount Received:** Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing cash flow and loan repayment dynamics. We scrutinize Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe MoM changes.
  
4. **Average Interest Rate:** Calculating the average interest rate across all loans and monitoring MoM variations provides insights into our lending portfolio's cost structure.
  
5. **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers aids in understanding their financial health. We compute the average DTI for all loans, track MTD changes, and observe MoM fluctuations.
